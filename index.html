                <h3>From Marketing To Development</h3>
                <p>After 10 years of driving traffic for direct sales teams, I learned the same skillset of understand and target user needs translates directly into effective SEO and user-friendly design.</p>
                <p>What started as a focus on marketing performance has evolved into building websites where usability, search visibility, and business goals work together.</p>
                <p>With the best of both worlds, the approach to modernizing websites for in-person commerce gives businesses a more promising path to visibility, engagement, and growth.</p>

                <p>In the completion of the Web Development program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology I've obtained the basic skills to build scalable applications using React and TypeScript. I have practical experience using CMS (WordPress, Joomla, WooCommerce, Drupal, Shopify, and Squarespace) and I'm addicted to using Tailwind for pixel-perfect designs. I am passionate about building user-friendly interfaces that focus on accessibility and UX to create that seamless user experience.</p>
